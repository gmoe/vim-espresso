## Installation

maintain your plugins:

1. Add the following to your `.vimrc`:
```vim
Plug 'gmoe/vim-espresso'
```
2. Restart vim and execute `:PlugInstall` to automatically download and install
   this plugin.

Or consider using Vim 8's [native plugin manager][vim8] and clone this repo
into your bundle.


Make sure to edit your `.vimrc` as well:

```vim
set t_Co=256
set background=dark
colorscheme espresso
```
